    MusicBrainz is an open music encyclopedia that collects music metadata and makes it available to the public.
    <br><br>
    MusicBrainz aims to be:

    <li>The ultimate source of music information by allowing anyone to contribute and releasing the data under open licenses.</li>
    <li>The universal lingua franca for music by providing a reliable and unambiguous form of music identification, enabling both people and machines to have meaningful conversations about music.</li>
    <br>
    Like Wikipedia, MusicBrainz is maintained by a global community of users and we want everyone, including you, to participate and contribute.
